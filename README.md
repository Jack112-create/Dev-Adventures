- The screenshot above provides the logic that was used to connect all the pieces of the game together. By creating a flow chart
for the game, I was able to visualise where certain classes needed to be instantiated and manipulated in order for the game to 
work correctly.

### Testing

#### Manual Testing


### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs
- Questions that contain of "All of the above" as an answer needed to be corrected due to the order of the answers being shuffled
and not placing the "All of the above" answer as the last answer. This bug was corrected by removing the "All of the above" answer from
the list of answers and re-adding it back to the list so that it will always be positioned at the last index of the choices.
